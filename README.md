- Stage 1: code the given figma file as close to the design as possible
- Stage 2: Make the code responsive
- You’re free to choose any technology of your comfort
- Deploy the static website

In this project I'm used Next.js and TailwindCSS Frame works.

## Work Process/ Challenges

- Build easy elements first.
- Responsive website.
- Reusable components are in components folder.
- Used TailwindCSS for Styling. It have greater flexibility, scalability and easy to maintenance.
- In CSS most used flex boxes.
- Images used webp format for better website performance and search engine optimization.
- To use images from figma, I'm used plugins that convert design to webp images.
- While stuck doing any components, I do watching any tutorial or any documentation across the web.
- Gradient the hero section feel some difficult. But I'm try to build it.
